## üìä Production Considerations

When discussing deployment:
1. **AWS Infrastructure**
   - ECS/Fargate for containers
   - RDS for PostgreSQL
   - S3 + CloudFront for frontend
   - SES for email, SNS for SMS

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - SSL/TLS certificates
   - AWS Secrets Manager
   - VPC and security groups
   - WAF for API protection

3. **Scalability**
   - Auto-scaling groups
   - Load balancers
   - Read replicas for database
   - CDN for static assets

4. **Monitoring**
   - CloudWatch logs and metrics
   - Application performance monitoring
   - Alerting for failed notifications
   - Audit trails for compliance
